### proJaved is a project that trawls [UBC's Scope](https://scope.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/students/student-login.htm) co-op posting board and automatically generates simple applications for students. 

- **Auto-addition**: The project is able to automatically add the job id, recepient, address, job title, and associate custom user paragraphs to specific skill requirements. 
- **Disclaimer**: This project is  not meant to replace the rigour of a manual application process. Rather, it is meant to automate the more mundane aspects of applying. 
- Applications should be vetted by the user before uploads occur. 

#### Dedication
This project goes out to our main man, Javed Iqbal.
